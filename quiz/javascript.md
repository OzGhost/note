# Series of question
* JavaScript is scripting or compile language?
* Hosting & var let const & TDZ
* 1 + '1' vs 1 - '1' & auto coercion
* Global object + what's up with var outside function
* this binding, new operator
* Event loop & asynchronization, screen freezing
* === vs == and your favorite
* Closure, lexical scope, memory leak
* Arrow function, anonymous function
* Prototype link & shadowing prop
* Promise, cancelation
* Strict mode
* Security potential
